Sign Language Recognition System
===========================

In this project, I will building a sign language recognition system using AI. Bla ... bla. This project is part of the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) program, from Udacity. You can check my report <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>


### Install
This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [jupyter](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)
- [hmmlearn](http://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `AIND_recognizer/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following command:

```shell
    $ jupyter notebook asl_recognizer.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and notebook in your browser which is where you will directly edit and run your code. Follow the instructions in the notebook for completing the project.


### Data
Take a look [here](data/README.md) to see more details about the datasets used in this project.
